      <p>The Oklahoma government passed a bill that restricts the teaching of critical <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/civil-rights-reimagining-policing/a-lesson-on-critical-race-theory/">race theory</a>at any schools, this law also includes banning many of the historical lessons we learned as kids. There were already so many gapes in the things we were taught, they sugar coated so much of the true racism in our country's history. Now they are fully getting rid of this country’s past, a heartbreaking story that people already didn’t know enough about. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law on Friday barring grade schools from teaching lessons about race or sex that may make students uncomfortable.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Many people have spoken up on their opinions about this new law, posting on social media, or speaking up through books or interviews. “It’s a law that protects white students from white fragility by banning any subject that forces them to think critically about American racism past, present or future,” wrote Zack Linly, “This isn’t about education, it’s about racism…. Banning [critical race theory] does just as much to further the divide as teaching it apparently does. Black feelings are being disregarded while white feelings are being catered to.” </p>
      <br>
      <p>Paula Lewis, the chairwoman of the Oklahoma City School Board, called HB 1775 “an outright racist and oppressive piece of legislation” on Twitter. “I am appalled at the flagrant attempt to erase factual, incomprehensible history that has occurred in the United States,” Lewis wrote in a Twitter thread. “Our history as a country and as a state, if told accurately, is uncomfortable and should be heartbreaking for Americans that look like me, white.”</p>
      <p>“The intention of the bill clearly aims to limit teaching the racial implications of America’s history. The bill serves no purpose than to fuel the racism and denial that afflicts our communities and our nation,” writes the commission. “It is a sad day and a stain on Oklahoma.”
     “The term critical race theory is being used by Republicans in a loose way to capture all sorts of critical thought about the histories and legacies of racism in this country,” Amna Akbar, an associate law professor at Ohio State University, told The Hill. “It’s a bogeyman that they’re constructing around critical attention to the history of the country.”</p>
     <br>
    <p>This is a good example of how racism still does exist even in a year like 2021 when acceptance has become a big deal. The educational system has for years been failing us, and instead of teaching us proper black history they have made it so that the egos of white people weren’t harmed. African American history is not something that we can learn about over a month. It takes time and has multiple layers, something that schools all around the world have failed to teach people in their youth. I won’t even start to speak on the fact that we aren’t taught about Asian history or any of the other amazing races there are in the world.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/constitution">constitution</a> states that everyone has the right to a fair trial after being claimed as <b>guilty</b> so they would be able to be proven <i>innocent.</i> The constitution didn’t call for biased opinions based on any of the features of the person under trial.</p>

      <p>The horrific nature of George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis Police Department officer on May 25, 2020 has sparked more than a month of nationwide protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Nearly all named George Floyd (50 [89%]), a majority noted the role of racism (43 [77%]) and acknowledged the Black community specifically (41 [73%]). Fewer ╌ slightly more than half ╌ referenced the act resulting in Floyd’s death (31 [55%]) or made explicit reference to the police (29 [52%]). Only 7 (13%) explicitly used terms denoting active support, like “antiracism” or “Black Lives Matter.” Most (45 [80%]) included references to negative <a href="https://www.definitions.net/definition/sequelae">sequelae</a> resulting from racism like <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/disparity">“disparities”</a> or <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/inequality">“inequality”.</a> A few  included hopeful language, but most failed to address this country’s targeted, historically engrained, and sustained oppression of Black people through white supremacy. This act of violence, in my opinion and many others agree with me, should have received a life sentence. He showed almost no signs of regret, and during his trial,  his eyes darted left and right over his light blue surgical mask as Judge Peter Cahill read the jury's verdict, but he betrayed little else in the way of emotion.</p>

      <p>The veteran police officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, may have accidentally grabbed her gun instead of her stun gun before the shooting, an assertion offered by the police chief. After firing her handgun, she yells, “Holy s---! I just shot him!” And in several recent cases, officers faced little to no consequences for what was deemed a mistake. </p>

        <p>Asian hate crimes have skyrocketed over the years, and people continuously use excuses to defend those who commit the crimes. Excuses such as, they didn’t know what they were doing, if they didn’t then they shouldn’t be on the police force. Or, they were “having a bad day,” if you are going to work in the justice system you should be able to control your own temper, and if you can’t then you shouldn’t be there.</p>

        <p>So many of today’s “aesthetics” and trends, have internalized racism that some may realize and choose to ignore, may not realize, and the growing percentage of people who speak up for those who aren’t white. White people don’t even realize the hypocrisy in some of the things they tend to do. They curl their hair to have beautiful luscious curls that african americans have, but tell those same african americans to “comb a brush through their hair.” They get plastic surgery to have full lips like many african americans, but ask them if a plastic surgeon blouched their surgery up, as a “joke.” They get plastic surgery to get the natural curves african americans have, then have the audacity to say that they probably did the same and got plastic surgery. And maybe even the worst, they judge african americans because of their skin color yet they tan theirs to have beautifully sun kissed skin. I can’t believe that some people could look someone in the eyes and say something racist when they do some of these things.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now as far as makeup goes, the foundation lines are one of the best examples of racism in the makeup industry. In so many famous foundation lines they have almost 10-20 color options for lighter skin toned people, while for darker colored people are stuck with around 3 options. This has caused some people to even use harmful and toxic skin lightening creams, and many other products. So many people with darker skin tones can’t seem to find a foundation color that actually matches their skin. This issue also occurs in contour, some of the colors quite literally blend into their skin when they are meant to seem like shadows.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nevermind the limited options for darker skinned followers, they also don’t have enough representation. I never see darker skinned people who model for big companies, even if there are lines with products for black people they rarely ever have models that are darker toned to show them off. In advertisements for curly hair products african american’s natural 4c hair are instead wavy because those are more “ideal” curls. In itself that is a whole racist concept, but the fact that people advertise those products as things for 4c curls is disrespectful for so many reasons.</p>
        <br>
        <p>People use Asian culture as an “aesthetic,” but don’t speak up for Asian hate crimes. It’s completely disrespectful that people think, the “kawai aesthetic” , which is a part of Japanese culture, as fun and quirky, without knowing anything about their culture. People even squint their eyes to have smaller appearing eyes, or line their water lines to make themselves look “cuter” but don’t even realize it’s racist. People wear Jade bracelets without knowing the cultural importance of that tradition, even if they did know the history it still wouldn’t be okay to wear them. And the fact that some people even sexualize kimono’s by adding decorative bows, or tying them in the non-traditional way, many Asians are perfectly fine with other races wearing kimonos. But you shouldn’t disrespect a culture by changing the style of an important tradition, it’s downright racist and disrespectful to the entire culture.</p>
