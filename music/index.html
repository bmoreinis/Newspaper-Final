          <h4>Written and coded by Joalis</h4>
          <audio controls="" preload="metadata" style="width:100%;margin:0 auto;"><source src="enobach.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>
          <p>Quarantine has given us lots of time to listen to music!  When my playlist of favorite songs runs out, Spotify suggests new songs based on those I like, so all this time online means I discover new music I likely would not have found otherwise. </p>            
          <p> Many students’ musical tastes have changed while being remote. Has yours changed? I notice that as I wait for my favorite artists to drop new music and albums, I find new names interesting, and sometimes I am interested in old music from over 7 years ago.</p>
          <p>Sometimes musical choices relate to emotions. When I feel sad I may listen to depressing music; when happy I may listen to pop or rap. I imagine there is most likely music for every feeling. If my musical tastes have changed over quarantine, that might be connected to other changes in how I feel generally, and how I'm doing.</p>
          <p>Because this interests me, I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPaua2P9oupeMDTTIvS6dJeTyXMKWdKy62ngzURk2Ao3yMxw/viewform">survey form</a> so other students could have a chance to ask that question. Everyone who took the survey listens to music a lot. Over half listen to music all the time. I expected most people to choose that.</p>
          <p>I think music is a stress reliever, or helps students concentrate by covering other sounds.  At home I hear a lot of sounds, like parents cooking or cleaning or vacuuming,  or my brothers playing.  I'd rather hear my own music. I bet that's true for you.</p>
          <p>Here's what students wrote in my survey:</p>
          <img src="1tastechange.png">
          <p>Almost 3/4 of people said yes, that their musical tastes had changed in big ways during quarantine.   Why did our tastes change? </p>
          <img src="2basedon.png">
          <p>Over 3 quarters of people choose which music to listen to based on their feelings. I wonder how people’s feelings  have changed during quarantine.</p> 
          <h3 style="font-style:italic;">What feelings are the songs and music you pick about lately?</h3>
          <img src="3labely.jpg">
          <p>The number of people that have been feeling sad or angry has doubled since the pandemic.I wonder which sad and angry music has been getting listened to the most.</p>
          <img src="feeling.jpg">
          <p>Almost 3 quarters of us feel more sadness and anger and other feelings when we listen to music that reflects our feelings.</p>
          <h3 style="font-style:italic;">If you feel a certain way, does the music make you feel MORE like that? </h3>
          <img src="musicwhy.jpg">
          <p>For the students that know why they listen to music based on their feelings ,half want to get over the feeling and half want to get deeper in their feelings. I'm like the second group. When I get deeper into my feelings It's easier for me to express them and expressing my feelings feels good even if they are sad or angry feelings, I still like to express them.</p>
          <p><i>I hope that students that listen to the music to get over their feelings may want to try and listen to have the feeling more and see how it will work out!</i><p>
          <div class="tables">
          <h2>What are people listening to now?</h2>
          <p>I build these tables from the responses people put in their forms, and tried to find examples on YouTube so you could listen, think about why they liked the music, and whether you do also.</p><hr>
