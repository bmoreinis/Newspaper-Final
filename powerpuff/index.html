    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:white;">CW choose who?</h2>
    <div class="p2">
    <p> CW has already decided on their cast list, with <i>Chloe Bennet</i> a half Chinese half Caucasian as Blossom, <i>Yana Perraut</i>, a mixed woman as Buttercup, and <i>Dove Cameron</i>, a mix of a few different races, as our one of a kind Bubbles. They have <i>Maggie Kiley</i> as their director, she also helped direct episodes in Riverdale, a hit CW t.v show. Now, I love all of the actors but I do think CW could have done a better job casting, a lot of the roles in this new live action push the stereotypes people have been working <i>so</i> hard to get rid of.</p></div>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px hotpink;color:white; text-align:center;">Blossoms Problems</h2>
    <div class="p3img">

    <p style="padding: 50px;">The bow dropping on Blossom</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
    <br>
    <p>They choose Chloe to play Blossom, a half Chinese woman even though many people thought Buttercup was Asian, they’ve even made fanart of Asian Buttercup. Yet they decided to make the <i>“nerdy”</i> character portrayed by a half Chinese woman. If you didn’t know, there is a stereotype of Asians that they are smart, goody-two shoes, and although they can be that, not <i>all</i> of them are. People have had this stereotype for <i>far</i> too long. And with a t.v show that many people watched as kids and would probably want to watch the reboot to be enforcing it could make some people think it’s okay. And it’s not. So casting an Asian as the character with all those stereotypical personality traits is pushing into that stereotype, even if they may not realize it.</p></div>

    <img src="./Buttercup.(PPG).full.2852954.jpg" style="float:right;width:150px;height:170px;">
    <br>
    <div class="p4">
    <p>As I stated earlier on, many people thought Buttercup was Asian, yet they choose a mixed woman to play their most aggressive character. Which pushes that “black girls are aggressive” stereotype. It’s not okay to push these stereotypes even if they don’t realize they are doing it. CW has a large group of people who watch them, and they shouldn’t represent any of these stereotypes. Yana has even said rude and anti-white comments on social media, and even though white people may have always had it better, we can’t be equal if we switch the roles. I think Chloe Bennet would have made a better choice for Buttercup, and she even has brown hair, the same as Buttercup. I don’t see <i>any</i> excuses for why they decided on who played who, the underlying stereotypes could have been avoided if they switched a few roles.</p></div>

    <h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px lightblue;color:white; text-align: center;">Pop Bubbles Bubble</h2>
    <img src="./0ef18c45d9290a3ede1a666847730e5f.jpg" style="float:left;width:150px;height:170px;">
    <br>
    <div class="p5">
      <p>And just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, they choose a white <i>passing</i> woman to play the "innocent, sweet" character. I don’t know if you see the problem there but if you <i>don’t</i> I’ll explain it. They already placed so many racial stereotypes on Blossom and Buttercup, but now they choose to get a white passing girl to play the <i>“nice”</i> character. It’s pushing this stereotype that white people are some sort of saints, which is just plain wrong. Everyone is different, it doesn’t matter your race or size, none of that matters with personality. But so many t.v shows still push stereotypes, sometimes not even based on race but instead gender, or sexuality. We really need to stop these stereotypes, they’re harmful and disrespectful to these races.</p></div>

      <h2 style="color:white; text-align:center;">Am I overreacting?</h2>
      <img src="./299-2997897_blossom-bubbles-and-buttercup-cartoon-animated-film-powerpuff-girls-bliss-fan-art.png" style="float:right;width:350px;height:370px;">
      <br>
      <div class="p6">
      <p>We all know the beloved PowerPuff iconic trio, the self proclaimed Gryffindor, the one who has the personality of your short friend, and the definition of a soft girl straight off of TikTok. Let’s get into the new live action version, and as for many animated series reboots, there will always be one thing they mess up on. So many animated t.v shows get live action robots and they end up taking away the representation. At least CW didn’t do that, instead they did something that may just be worse. The summary of this t.v show as professionally written by them: <b>“Now they’re disillusioned twentysomethings who resent having lost their childhood to crime fighting. Will they agree to reunite now that the world needs them more than ever?”</b></p></div>
      <div class="p7">
      <p>You may think it’s an <i><b>“over reaction”</b></i> but these issues have been going on well over a century, and now with more modern technology there are more ways to spread this thought process. We should be using this more modern world to convince people that we are all <i>equal</i>, and some people do, but others use it to spread false information. Starting with big t.v shows like this should use their platforms to help get rid of these stereotypes.</p></div>
